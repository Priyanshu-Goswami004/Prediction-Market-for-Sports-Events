Prediction Market for Sports Events
Project Description
A decentralized prediction market platform built on Ethereum that allows users to bet on sports events outcomes. Users can place bets on Team A wins, Team B wins, or Draw scenarios, with winnings distributed proportionally based on the total betting pools. The platform features an oracle system for result verification and automated payout distribution.
Project Vision
To create a transparent, decentralized, and trustworthy sports betting platform that eliminates traditional bookmaker margins and gives users better odds through peer-to-peer betting pools. Our vision is to democratize sports betting by removing intermediaries and providing a fair, community-driven betting experience where odds are determined by actual market demand rather than centralized bookmakers.
